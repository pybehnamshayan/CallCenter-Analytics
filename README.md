# 🚀 Customer Satisfaction Prediction – My First Machine Learning Project  

## 📢 Introduction  

As a **Call Center Agent at Irancell**, I interact with customers daily and understand how factors like **call duration, response time, and call reason** influence customer satisfaction. This experience inspired me to dive into **machine learning** and develop a predictive model to analyze customer interactions.  

Since I **didn't have access to real customer data**, I generated **synthetic data** based on industry insights. Using this dataset, I built a **customer satisfaction prediction model** with **Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM**. The goal? To predict customer satisfaction scores and identify key factors that impact service quality.

## 📊 Project Overview  

🔹 **Problem Statement:** Predict customer satisfaction based on call center interaction data.  
🔹 **Challenges:** No access to real data, so I created **synthetic data**.  
🔹 **Goal:** Improve customer experience by analyzing call center performance.  

### ✨ Key Features  

✅ **Data Preprocessing** – Handled categorical & numerical features  
✅ **Feature Engineering** – Created meaningful features like:  
   - **Response-to-Duration Ratio**  
   - **Agent Average Satisfaction Score**  
✅ **Hyperparameter Tuning** – Used **GridSearchCV** for optimization  
✅ **Ensemble Learning** – Combined **RandomForest, XGBoost, and LightGBM**  
✅ **Achieved 54% Accuracy** with synthetic data
